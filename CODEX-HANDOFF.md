# Codex development handoff — LitBeacon Research Workspace

This file is a **test pull-request handoff**, not a feature release. It records a safe starting point for continuing development with Codex. The repository is still named `LitRadar` on GitHub, while the public-facing application name is **LitBeacon**.

## Starting point

- Repository: `Light-Danube/LitRadar`, default branch `main`.
- Current release at the time of this handoff: **v0.8.0** (verify `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` before changing code).
- Read `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `BRANDING.md`, and `UI-REVIEW-v0.8.md` before planning the next version.
- The local-first Python CLI, Textual TUI, Telegram bot, digest/scheduler, and FastAPI browser workspace share the existing SQLite database. Preserve compatibility with legacy `LITRADAR_*` configuration, `data/litradar.sqlite3`, and Windows launchers.

## Suggested Codex task

Improve the v0.8.x citation map and research workspace incrementally, starting with **graph usability**: pan/zoom, clear reference/cited-by/related edge labels, node selection, and bounded display. Then add annotation provenance and tests. Propose a small, reviewable PR rather than a full redesign.

## Development workflow

1. Create a feature branch from the current `main`; do not commit directly to `main`.
2. Inspect the actual implementation and tests before modifying interfaces or storage.
3. Keep migrations additive and existing data intact. Do not overwrite or commit `.env`, SQLite databases, API keys, Telegram tokens, local caches, downloaded PDFs, or `.venv`.
4. Install dependencies as needed: `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`, `requirements-ui.txt`, `requirements-llm.txt`, and `requirements-web.txt`. Heavy/optional packages should not block core workflows.
5. Run `python -m pytest -q` and `python -m compileall -q .`; run `node --check web/static/app.js` if Node is available. For UI changes, smoke-test `python cli.py web` locally. Report skips and unavailable tools explicitly.
6. Update `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the handoff when scope changes.
7. Open a **draft PR** with a concise summary, test results, migration notes, and screenshots for visual changes. Leave merging to the repository owner.

## Guardrails

- Preserve the local-only binding for the unauthenticated web server; do not expose it publicly.
- Citation/lexical heuristics are not evidence of scientific novelty.
- Use existing graph/storage models where possible; avoid introducing a second database or mandatory frontend build system without a demonstrated need.
- Distinguish tests executed in the environment from CI results not yet observed.

## First smoke test

This document is intentionally the only file added in the initial Codex connectivity PR. Its purpose is to verify branch creation, commit, and draft PR review before handing over larger engineering changes.
